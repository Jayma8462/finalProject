#finalProject

Communication plan:
How will your group communicate with each other?
-Each team member has agreed to answer in out slack channel as much as possible with the restrictions of work and kids.
-We have given out email to each other to also have a back up messaging method
-We also have the lab days when we are sitting here
What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to?
-Acknowledging each idea, if an idea is said that someone does not like then we speak up and to why they like it or why they dont or why it will work or why it does not
Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
-If we get to the point where people can not agree on an idea, we agreed to break it down to the voting system and that we will work even if the group does not agree with the out voted person.
-In the event of a tie then we will pull a TA or a teacher or even another student into the group to be the odd man out as the final vote
What will your process be to resolve it?
-voting system
-TA's or teacher as stated above
Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
-Team lead and the assist team lead will assign the tasks and making sure they get completed on time.
-If someone open of us feels like we cant do or feel comfortable with then we can re assign or help them work through it.
-If a last min task comes up the item will be added into the repo and assigned to a person. The team lead and the assistant both will be able to add new tasks and re assigning them accordingly
In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing
-Each task will be assigned and completed per person and tracked in the REPO task order. This will be sent over to a file in the repo that we can add into a document into the repo
