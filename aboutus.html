        <p id = "aboutUsText1">Greetings! My name is Joel Epstein and I am a programming student at Code Fellows. In this episode of our coding adventure, we created a Tour Seattle page that will guide both local and foreign visitors around Seattle. Dubbed as the Emerald City, Seattle has no shortage of lush evergreen forests that brought in diverse demographics from all over the world. This influx of immigrants opened up doors to diverse cultures and cuisines in Seattle. With over hundreds of restaurants to choose from, this page will serve as a useful tool for the avid foodie to navigate through Seattle's food scene. My favorite food is carne asada tacos.</p>

        <p id = "aboutUsText2">Hello and welcome to our site! My name is Dalton Carr. I am currently enrolled at Codefellows to work torwards my certificate in
        Full-stack Javascript. Im from Las Vegas, Nevada originally so this project was perfect because I also got to learn about a ton of awesome grub spots! We created this site to help tourist or even locals find the perfect restaurant based on what they feel like eating that day.
        I picked out the Italian restaurants for this project and boy oh boy was I hungry this entire project. I can't wait to try them all! My favorite so far is Mamma Melina's in the U-district</p>

        <p id = "aboutUsText1">Hello there!  I am Hanh-Thao Luu, a programming student at Code Fellows.  We came up with the idea of the Seattle Tour Game in hope of guiding others who are unfamiliar with Seattle’s gems. Living in Seattle, besides the majestic mountains and beautiful bodies of water, we are blessed with many delicious dishes from diverse cultures. In addition, if you are a vegan or a vegetarian, there are wonderful vegetarian options for you also. For the time sake of this project, it's not possible to have all the restaurants listed on our webpage. For my part, I hand-picked some of the asian restaurants that I would recommend. My favorite restaurant is Bamboo Garden. Bon appétit! </p>

        <p id = "aboutUsText2">Greetings! My name is Albert Portune but i go by James. I came from an IT background and wanted a change so I became a student at Codefellows. I spent 6 year in the Marine Corps as a Server Administrator working with hardware and setting up operation centers as fun as that is I found software development way more interesting and fun so I made a move to become a software developer. I love food and love cooking food too, so our project idea from Thao is perfect for me as a foodie and as someone who does not know Seattle well. My favorite place that i have tried thus far is Salvatore Ristorante Italiano and my favorite dish is Baked Ziti. </p>
