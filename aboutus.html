In this episode of our coding adventure, we created a Tour Seattle page that will guide both local and foreign visitors around Seattle. Dubbed as the Emerald City, Seattle has no shortage of lush evergreen forests that brought in diverse demographics from all over the world. This influx of immigrants opened up doors to diverse cultures and cuisines in Seattle. With over hundreds of restaurants to choose from, this page will serve as a useful tool for the avid foodie to navigate through Seattle's food scene. My favorite food is carne asada tacos.</p>

        <p id = "aboutUsText1">Hello there!  I am Hanh-Thao Luu, a programming student at Code Fellows.  I came up with the idea of the Seattle Tour Game in hope of guiding others who are unfamiliar with Seattle’s gems. Living in Seattle, besides the majestic mountains and beautiful bodies of water, we are blessed with many delicious dishes from diverse cultures. In addition, if you are a vegan or a vegetarian, there are wonderful vegetarian options for you also. For the time sake of this project, it's not possible to have all the restaurants listed on our webpage. For my part, I hand-picked some of the asian restaurants that I would recommend. My favorite restaurant is Bamboo Garden. Bon appétit! </p>
