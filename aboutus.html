      <!-- Joel's about me -->
      <p id = "joelAboutMe">Greetings! My name is Joel Epstein and I am a programming student at Code Fellows. In this episode of our coding adventure, we created a Tour Seattle page that will guide both local and foreign visitors around Seattle. Dubbed as the Emerald City, Seattle has no shortage of lush evergreen forests that brought in diverse demographics from all over the world. This influx of immigrants opened up doors to diverse cultures and cuisines in Seattle. With over hundreds of restaurants to choose from, this page will serve as a useful tool for the avid foodie to navigate through Seattle's food scene. My favorite food is carne asada tacos.</p>
